# **Video Games Sales Dashboard**

This interactive Tableau dashboard provides a detailed analysis of video game sales data, with a focus on total sales, game genres, platforms, publishers, and the sales of games across the years . It's designed to give a clear, at-a-glance view of sales performance across various dimensions of the video game industry.

## 1)Total Sales (Primary Metric):

The dashboard uses total sales as the central metric to evaluate game performance, providing insights into the most popular games, as well as overall sales trends across different years

## 2)Genre Distribution:

A bar chart could show the total sales for different game genres (e.g., action, adventure, role-playing, sports). This gives viewers a quick overview of which genres dominate the market in terms of sales.
Here I have used multiple dropdown to allow users to drill down into specific genres to further analyze top-selling games within each category.

## 3)Game Names:

A bar chart is included to display the top-performing games by total sales.

## 4)Platforms:

A Bubble chart is included to display the sales data by platforms (e.g., Wii,DS,Xbox PC), showing how each platform contributed to the total sales across various years. This could help identify trends in platform popularity over time.

## 5)Publishers:

A Tree chart could show total sales broken down by publishers, helping to identify the most successful companies in the video game industry.

## 6)Yearly Trends:
The dashboard might also feature a year slider or filter to allow users to explore sales trends for specific years, helping them understand how the market has changed over time.

## 7)Interactivity:

Filters or interactive controls could allow users to drill into specific years, platforms, genres, or publishers. For example, selecting a particular genre could dynamically update other visualizations, such as the top-selling games for that genre or the corresponding publisher/platform breakdowns.

Tooltips could display additional details, such as the exact sales figures, game release dates, or platform sales, providing context when hovering over data points.
